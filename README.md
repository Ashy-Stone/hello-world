# hello-world
My first GitHub repo!

I have used Git at work, but have not utilized GitHub. I plan to hopefully use it more.

## Why was this created?

The repo was created to help me get more familar with the GitHub interface.

In addition, this repo was created from following GitHub's 'hello-world' tutorial: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
